            <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                 pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the 
                 State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;
                 [9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu 
                 pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was
                the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been 
                wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. 
                Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its 
                fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim
                ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders and 
                local women. Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island
                and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a 
                young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add to the family's meager income. With the 
                opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the
                 family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.
